# Logs Analysis
A Udacity FSND project.

## Introduction
This is the solution for the Logs Analysis project in Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree course. In this, we have to execute complex queries on a large database (> 1000k rows) to extract intersting stats.

The database in question is a newspaper company database where we have 3 tables; articles, authors and log.

 - articles - Contains articles posted in the newspaper so far.
 - authors - Contains list of authors who have published their articles.
 - log - Stores log of every request sent to the newspaper server.

This project implements a single query solution for each of the question in hand. 
See [main.py](https://github.com/cangir-education/udacity-fsnd-logs-analysis/blob/master/main.py) for more details.
